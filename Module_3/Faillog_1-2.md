Regex
Searches for patterns
Looking for exceptions – problem solving
Apparently I left my dhbox expire because my password doesn’t work
Took a minute to re-set up everything in command line
Gonna have to watch the video because I see no index anywhere
Nevermind I’m an idiot
Couldn’t figure out how to scroll down
Steps 1 and steps 2 pretty easy, figuring out how to find pattern
Once find pattern, then x happens 
Adding tildes and getting rid of irrelevant lines
Third one is tricky
Matter of precision 
Coding miss one bracket and everything doesn’t work
More about fixing what you screwed up than writing new code
4 is pretty easy, just removing tildes
5 is straightforward as well
6 just have to show where double commas
I survived! Hallelujah
Not a big fan of formatting/cleaning up/generally making thing visually pretty. I guess I’ve always liked problem solving generally more than the actual details.. 

Ex 2
Open Refine
Following tutorial here
http://workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/supporting%20materials/open-refine/
Had to look at the video to see, using v2.8 not 3 beta
I’m assuming anyways
Managed to install open refine no problem but ends up I missed a step or something because the “to” is still there and no sender
Yep somehow forgot to actually input step 5  from exercise 1
Okay some backtracking later I think I’m okay now?
Reuploading new files to github
Okay trying this again
NOPE its still screwing up
Oh apparently I missed exercise 6 adding the column part
Oops
Clearly I need sleep or something
This is what happens when I’m not allowed to have coffee
Or I’m just dumb
3rd time is the charm!
I finally figured it out!!!! I feel so accomplished
I somehow got 4 extra columns so just going to delete those by hand (edit > remove column)
Cluster tool so far is really cool (and useful)
Yay being able to fix mistakes in data to make it useable
I apparently have way to much data (like thousands) most likely due to me screwing up last time
Can’t figure out how to fix it so we are just gonna go with it…
Clustering with multiple different options for both sender and recipient 
Tried to do the best I could especially with names
Exporting took a while but finally got it to work!
Changed names to target and source
Getting eyestrain so gonna take a quick break
Now just a matter of uploading files
Done!
