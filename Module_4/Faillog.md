Downloaded gephi
I think something definitely went wrong last time because somehow text ended up in my imported list (not just names)
Not sure what to do about it though, so I guess I’ll just see what happens?
Copying column easy enough though I don’t see weight anywhere….
Found it, I’m just an idiot
Actually this solved my excess data problem, since all the erroneous data was labeled as “1” and mostly grouped together 
Trying to go slowly just to make sure I don’t accidentally delete actual data
Nevermind this is taking wayyy too long.
Reimporting data, so that all the errors are at end ( I think)
Somehow an entire letter got mixed up with my data or something
More like 20 letters….
I am now down from 9000 nodes to about 1000
Now to start the exercise over again….
On the graph page now. I still have more nodes than I should but not that much more
Running Force Atlas 2 now. So cool! Data keeps moving
Immediately some points left to nowhere, now the center points still moving but very slowly
A few min of watching it later, I stopped it from running to continue on
I found the wording on the next couple steps a bit confusing (since I had to go through a bunch of menus to filter out the outliers and these instructions weren’t always in order) but I figured it out
Now have the face rank on the data lab nodes page which is pretty cool!
I don’t see a red diamond but I assume the tutorial meant the “size option” 
Running force atlas 2 again…
Voila! after putting it into the preview it worked!
I’m now having way too much fun zooming in and looking at the network
Curious myself as to the Sam Houston question – why is he so small in this network? Also Buchanan surprisingly irrelevant in this data set

I like the fact that reorganizing data like this makes you think in different ways
Somehow makes the names seem more human too? Not sure how to describe it, but somehow dots and interconnecting lines with people they were in contact with makes it seem more organic than just a list of names
Also cool that you can see both the big picture or zoom in on one person’s correspondence
Not sure if this is possible, but it would be cool if you clicked on the lines to be able to show that exact letter
Anyways, I could probably make observations all day, but I should move on to the next module. Time to export and upload to github!

Ex 2
For some reason, dh box can load every page except my apps page
Been waiting for dh box to load for about 5 min now
Getting an internal server error (print screen attached) 
Since this seems to be an issue with dh box itself and not my connection (every other page on dh box works fine, my internet is fine, vpn is fine) I’m just going to skip on to exercise 3

Ex 3
Since my dh box isn’t working for some reason, just going to download R studio on my machine
Never heard of R or Rstudio, but excited to learn
First doing the quick intro to Rstudio
Setting up version control now…. And it doesn’t seem to be working
I guess for just this exercise I don’t need version control. Living dangerously!
Coding takes up a much larger portion of the screen than excel, which is interesting
After the simple math problems time to move on to the exercise
Trying to follow this: http://hist3907b-winter2015.github.io/module4-holes/tm-CND.html

Cannot change working directory error 
Now all I’m getting from any command is errors
Trying from scratch in different directory
Nope still getting errors
I feel like it’s some sort of error on how my machine is set up….. Wouldn’t be a problem if my dh box decided to work
Tried changing the directory to 3 different things and none of them work
Even skipping the directory line, library code doesn’t work
Apparently none of these library packages exist
Well I’m sure this is a lovely program but it’s making me cry right now so I’m moving onto the next one

Ex 4
Well we are now 4 exercises in and I’ve managed to complete 1 of them so that’s fine
Normally I’d spend more time trying to figure out where I’m going wrong but for my own mental health I think it’s better I just move on and try to accomplish something… anything
Signed up for overview
The instructions says something about choosing important word although I don’t see where to do that…
Just going to upload and see what happens
Ohhh now I see lots of words in a cloud
And getting the tagging tutorial
Now finding where the document sets label is
Now the fun part; being able to play with the data
Decided to start making location tags, both general (country, state,) and specific (Britain, America)
Interesting to see which ones overlap – some documents make comparisons whilst others talk about one place great detail
Caution with some documents since words like “state” has different meanings depending on the context
Also, “Washington” being both a place and a person frequently referenced
Added quite a few tags, so exported the tags themselves as a spreadsheet to add to my github
Also exported the new tagged document set as a spreadsheet
Now creating data trees for America and Canada just for fun
Britain is a little trickier since it’s referred to by so many different names
Anyways, the point of this is I am actually amazed at how much you can tell about each document using only the place names
Ones that are tagged by lots of countries are (obviously) more global in its scope
Others focus only on one place or none at all
Sometimes, what is tagged also infers what isn’t tagged. For example, one document tagged only with “Spanish” and “town” was actually about Jamaica (which I hadn’t tagged), but given the Spanish in the south that makes sense
If I were to continue this, being able to narrow down what to check based on the existing tags would be very useful
Incidentally, I did check for “Ottawa” but apparently its not a very popular place in this data. It only appeared twice and only one was actually referring to here in Canada (the other appears to be describing an Ottawa in the states).  Compare this to London which was referred to 46 times!

EX 5
Now going to learn how to use something called Antconc. Following this tutorial here:
https://hfroehli.ch/workshops/getting-started-with-antconc/
Found an article but not sure if I should be opening it in this antconc thing or not? (don’t even have a link to download yet so I’m assuming not)
Surprised to actually be using word in this course! :P Saved to .txt file with word
Downloaded corpus (although to my school folder, my desktop is too cluttered as is)
It’s giving me instructions for saving antconc on internet explorer and firefox, as I use neither I’m just going to hope for the best
Just went to where the file was downloaded and “run as admin” seemed to work
Can’t print screen for some reason, but thus far managed to import positive and negative reviews okay!
Took quite a while to load all the “the” hits
Sort appears very useful, highlighting words nearby
Sorting context I guess?
Wildcard a cool idea to group similar words together 
Could be useful for detecting spelling errors as well? (kind of like the clustering from last module)
 Quick break bc eyestrain
Now comparing the wom?n to m?n searches and saving them
Wow “she” appears way less than “he”, a research question I definitely didn’t want to think about today
Now its asking us to practice using the collocates tab but since I’m really not in the mood to reflect on the lack of representation of my gender in media I’m going to search using “dog” instead 
Does seem very useful as a tool to further understand how these words are being used
Comparing of course is great since that opens up a lot of questions
