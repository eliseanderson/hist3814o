Hello! Welcome to my github
Time to put the Fail back into Fail log!
Allow me to disappoint you all by saying ive had absolutely no time to work on this (exam, brothers birthday, family in town, work) and I hate myself for it
But that’s life
Sometimes its 7:30 and you have 4 and a half hours to accomplish a weeks worth of work 
So lets come up with a game plan shall we
Due to time constraints, going to defy the defined order on the website and start with doing the exercises 1-3 first
Most important is to learn how to do things for the rest of the course, and want to give myself enough time for the 200-500 word thing
And I know from experience (aka last min comp sci assignments) that you want plenty of time for tech because things will inevitably go wrong
Sadly, going to hold off on the exercise 4 for now (ironically the part I was most looking forward to) because apparently it is the least vital. Best case scenario I’ll have time to do it before midnight, but worst case scenario I can just push myself tomorrow/sometime I’m not on the verge of a panic attack and just sacrifice marks for it
This is a long way of saying that after exercises 1-3 I will then annotate the readings, because I’ve had some experience with hypothesis so I’m less worried about screwing that part up
Oh though I also have to leave myself enough time to do a blog post/reflection on the readings too
And also a blog post about doing the exercises
Now that I have somewhat of a game plan, I should probably start doing all that now

Exercise 1
Time to learn why markdown is awesome 
Definitely bookmarking the cheatsheet for later when I want to do more complicated things
Time to find an interesting hypothesis quote…
Found one I found interesting:
https://hyp.is/EJGWbFYHEeiFfD8om_WIGA/www.trevorowens.org/2008/03/sunrise-on-methodology-and-radical-transparency-of-sources-in-historical-writing/
Now reading the debate on it, guess I wasn’t the only one to take note of it! Will reply in hypothesis later..
Probably getting too into writing… at 300 words when min is 200. But it’s interesting to think about!
I could probably write all day
I’ve been doing web annotations as I go, but now need to find cc images
…And it crashed
….And my internet is down now.
FINALLY 20 min and one mini panic attack later I fixed it! But now on an even worse time crunch….

Exercise 2
Who knew using vpns constantly to use American google while I was in France would come in handy!
Although somehow even though I created a dh box last week, my pass isn’t working and I’ll have to create a new dh box
Oh the joys of technology
My internet is still cutting in and out…
Time to annotate more readings while I wait 5 years for it to create one for me
Good news, the rest of the exercise ran relatively smoothly! Sometimes I got some lag in command line but that’s probably just my internet acting up again
Basically just had to follow the instructions 


Exercise 3
Already made a github for last semester woo – first part done!
Made a repository by following the instructions in the workbook… pretty straight forward
The instructions didn’t call for it, but I made a Module_1 subfolder within the hist3814o one (with readme) just to stay organized
PS in case anyone doesn’t know, you can make a folder by clicking “new file”, writing a folder name, then writing “/”
That took me an embarrassingly long time to figure out last semester
Also uploaded the html file, the history exercise .md file and my 200-500 hypothesis reflection thing from exercise 1 (transparency.md) because the more I can show my work (and access it from anywhere) the better!
Ugh, I really want to do exercise 4 right now : ( BUT I MUST REFRAIN since I still need to do 2 blog posts and finish annotating in 2 hours
Wish me luck!
