# Historians and Transparency: Hypothesis Reflection

### Elise Anderson

The last two weeks, those of us in the 3814o class have been utilizing the browser plugin [Hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/) to annotate readings regarding digital history. One of these readings was an [article](http://www.trevorowens.org/2008/03/sunrise-on-methodology-and-radical-transparency-of-sources-in-historical-writing/) by Trevor Owens on the importance of source transparency for historians and how digital technology can be used to accomplish this. To illustrate his point, he cites a Wired.com [article](https://www.wired.com/2008/02/ff-nuclearwar/?currentPage=all) by historian Jeremi Suri, which Owens applauds for directly linking readers to primary sources in which his research was based. 

This led to an interesting discussion amongst my peers about how digital source transparency could affect historian's work. The comment that struck me the most was the original [post](https://hyp.is/EJGWbFYHEeiFfD8om_WIGA/www.trevorowens.org/2008/03/sunrise-on-methodology-and-radical-transparency-of-sources-in-historical-writing/) by user sherlynassam. In it, they suggest source transparency in articles could be useful as a way to ensure historians are "honest" in portraying history (as readers could examine their sources themselves and not just the historian's narrative). Personally, I found this interesting as it forced me to reflect on my own opinions on both the importance of transparency and the portrayal of history in general. 

On one hand, being allowed to easily access the sources in which historians write their research on is very valuable. This would allow for readers (historian and non historian alike) to assess the value of these sources for themselves or possibly utilize them in their own research. There is so much of both information and misinformation on the internet that transparency is more vital than ever.

On the otherhand, I respectfully disagree that transparency will force "honesty" in historical work, for a number of reasons. As users [MarkyMarc](https://hyp.is/EJGWbFYHEeiFfD8om_WIGA/www.trevorowens.org/2008/03/sunrise-on-methodology-and-radical-transparency-of-sources-in-historical-writing/) and [Kathrynoliver](https://hyp.is/EJGWbFYHEeiFfD8om_WIGA/www.trevorowens.org/2008/03/sunrise-on-methodology-and-radical-transparency-of-sources-in-historical-writing/) state, this will not prevent innate author bias.  It could reduce possible transgressions and encourage readers to think for themselves, but the fact that it's written by a human means that the author will be biased to some degree no matter how honest they intend to be.

In addition, I personally always refute the idea that history is made of concrete "facts" to begin with. Everything we know about history is interpretations, and it's frequently impossible know for sure what happened. It is important to remember that even primary sources should not be taken at total face value. Whether the author intended to mislead or not does not necessarily correlate with accuracy or usefulness.
